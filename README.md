# RNN-Based Language Modeling and Classification Project

![Project Banner](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240208053129/lstm.webp)

## ðŸ“š **Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of two tasks: 

1. **RNN Classifier**: Predicts whether a given sequence of characters is followed by a vowel or a consonant.  
2. **RNN Language Model**: Predicts the next character in a sequence, based on text from Wikipedia's first 100 million characters.

This project was created as part of my coursework for the *CM3604 â€“ Deep Learning* module at [Robert Gordon University](https://www.rgu.ac.uk/).

## ðŸš€ **Features**

- Implementation of **LSTM** and **GRU** models in PyTorch.
- Includes training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning functionalities.
- Demonstrates performance with metrics like **accuracy** and **perplexity**.
- Modular code for easy customization and reuse.
